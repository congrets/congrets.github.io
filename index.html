					<p style="word-wrap: break-word; font-size: 20px; position: absolute; top: 30px">I believe that the ability to actualize one's desires is the most important ability anyone can have. I have many ideas for contraptions, games, etc. that I believe knowing how to program would be essential to bringing them to life. As a result of this, I pursue my field because I want to have the ability to bring my ideas to the real world. I'd like for my creations to have a positive impact on future generations the way past creations have improved my life.
